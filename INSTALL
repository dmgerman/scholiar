Xournal Installation instructions
=================================

Binary installer:
-----------------

The tarball includes an executable file for Linux IA32.  If your setup
is sufficiently standard, you might be able to use the binary installer
script, "install-binary".

Either run this script as root, to install xournal in /usr/local/bin
(and the dependencies in /usr/local/share/xournal), or as any user, to
install xournal in your home directory.

You will still need to have gtk+ 2.4 or later and the other required
libraries installed on your system (see below).

Otherwise, read on for compilation and installation instructions.
