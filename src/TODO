List of features to be implemented (not in any particular order)
----------------------------------------------------------------

- collaborative editing (see discussion with Erik Demaine)
- porting to MacOS; merge Nokia port
- multiple-scenario undo history

- collaborative: allow non-x86 endianness (for ints, for floats?)
- collaborative: have an initial undo item = contents of the initial
  xoj file + attachments for bitmap, pdf, and ps backgrounds

- cleanup of undo history (keep track of refcounts, delete old undo)
  save-and-clear-undo ?

- RandR / recalibration awareness?
  (e.g. if xinput events are far away from core events, re-query geometry?)
   or see if removing the GTK bugfix would help? -- e.g. by recalling an
   internal gtk init function?

BUGS:
** lingering issues with synaptics touchpads? (#2872667)
 (todo) - set device to Absolute mode at startup? (GDK doesn't expose API,
          cf XSetDeviceMode() in /usr/include/X11/extensions/XInput.h)
** color picker into canvas doesn't work in GTK+ 2.16 (should disable
   xinput first?)
** export to PDF should see cropbox size if smaller, and map the
   cropbox -- not the entire page -- to the page area! (2009-11-18 forum)

WIN32:
- test further
- write an installer
- bug: opening files with accents in name?
- bug: cairo-scaled-font in printing? (2009-11-18 bug tracker)

PATCHES TO INCORPORATE:
** patch: ortho/snap (revised Apr 13 2009)
   xournal_ortho_snap_patch_4 (by Josef Pavlicek)

** patch (Ian-Woo Kim): multicolumn mode + LASSO SELECTION
   xournal_lasso_multipage_zoom_button_20090620.patch

** autosave patch (Edward Yang) (should fix: optional only, w/ menu + cfgfile
   entries; fix: should clean up autosave.xoj.bg* files too; config interval)
   0001-Implement-autosave-for-documents-revised.patch (2 seconds after
   modification, vs original 5 seconds)
   *** NEW VERSION: #2881919 (autosave for 0.4.5, w/ some changes)
   NB: last modif should be triggered by prepare_new_undo() and undo/redo?
   *** NEW VERSION: with threading, by Man, e-mail 12/10/2009 10:51pm

** insert images patch (Victor Saase) #2890925
** customize paper ruling (Gautam Iyer e-mail Nov 30 2009 / SF tracker)

- option to map device named "touch" to hand tool? (like "Eraser tip")

- make line spacing in text objects customizable: to a fixed scaling factor,
  a fixed number of units, or the paper ruling (esp. the latter!!)

- PDF bg memory usage throttling / delete oldest pdf backgrounds
- replace ttsubset by something more modern? (eg. from cairo ?)
- auto-hide patch from ~/prog/src/xournal-autohide/ ?
     (check for cpu usage; handle BOTH edges
      and only (un)hide stuff at the correct edge!)
** UI update (Bob McElrath) -- eliminating status bar, compact layout,
   "compact interface" by default; themes, with line in config file
   to load pixmaps from pixmaps/$THEME/ (see Jan 9, 2009 emails)
- horizontal mode instead of dual-view / multicolumn ?
** "new page before/after" on a PDF bg page should ask: same page, other page of
  PDF file, default paper
- new recognizer icon (andruk on patches tracker)
- recognizer: if variable-width, associate average width
- recognizer should snap to existing recognized geometric shapes
- patch to find text in PDF (dmg = Daniel German, Nov 13 2009)

- improve recognizer: two passes for polygons (low tolerance, then higher)
  to better detect elongated rectangles? (if low tolerance recognizer
  doesn't get a rectangle, then use higher tolerance for everything else,
  since otherwise there's too much risk of splitting a segment into 2)
- snap-to-grid (also for ruler & recognizer vertices)
  and maybe also snap-to-vertices (option for ruler and recognizer)?
- config option: config save current tool options instead of default ones

- bug in truetype subset generation w/ Adobe 9, see if gtk-print any better?

- drag-and-drop, copy-paste text & images directly into xournal
- proximity detection: eraser proximity switches mapping? 
  proximity out removes cursor until next motionnotify?

- render page to bitmap: for export, preview, and copy-paste
    (render using libart, see how gnomecanvas does it?)
    NO: render using Cairo !!! then can switch to GtkPrint as well.
    (copy-paste: config option to render only current layer or all below?)
- cut-and-paste of selection into other apps (as bitmap; as SVG?)

- navigation sidebar with bitmap page previews
- bitmap preview for document icon in desktop environments?
- "organizer" side panel (hierarchy of notes), cf. gjots
- maintain e-library: table of md5sums of pdfs with associations
  to the corresponding xoj's absolute paths (cf. forum topic
  "Use MD5..." of Dec 2009)

- see iRex code for generic viewer + PDF plugin including caching,
  throttling etc. (Marcel Hendrickx email of Sep 11 '09) 

- allow toolbar to go vertical
- toolbar buttons should react to button 2/3 click to modify settings
  for that tool!!

- paste text directly into xournal, from xournal?
    (instead of starting a text item and pasting into/from it)
- insert links (to URLs; within document/to other xoj? hand mode navigates)
- a command + keyboard shortcut to switch mappings (1<->2, 1<->3, 2<->3)
     (A. Rechnitzer Sept 11, 2007)
- modify encoding of TrueType font subsets or provide cmap so pdf text
  can be extracted

- smoothing of strokes (for users without tablets / with deficient drivers)
- lasso tool
- add config option to limit total memory usage for PDF bitmaps
- ability to select entire page for copy-paste (as bitmap / reorder xournal)
- copy/paste of an entire page (beware if PDF bg is not compatible!)
- rewrite printing using GtkPrint + Cairo as GnomePrint replacement
   (keep GnomePrint option for compatibility with GTK+ <2.10)
- insert images (screen capture or from file or from clipboard), 
  not as full-page backgrounds (new ITEM type)

- convert to/from Jarnal format; to/from MS Journal format???
- export as SVG, as bitmap (use Cairo for this)
- improved PDF viewer features (search text, hyperlink, page borders...)
   (using full poppler api ?)
- search text: among PDF background (using poppler); among text annotations

- use system paper size as default (/etc/papersize)
- sticky notes (anchor visually text box to a bg location)
- use relative paths for bg documents (e.g. annotated PDF)
- flush display queue when drawing over a slow X server?
- more paper customization (in particular, 1/2 inch graph paper)
    (2 custom papers with settings in config file? 
     a folder with blank PDF or xoj papers and quick-access?)
    (also: engineering paper; isometric paper -- Dan Ott  Sep 4 '09)
- option to map a button to a context menu (incl. tool selection, ...)
- option to map a button to "undo"
- xournal_page-shadow.diff (Martin Kiefel Feb 5 2007)
- xoj2pdf on command line
- 'insert blank page after' command (more useful in PDF annot !)
- load images as bg if given on command-line (as with PDF on commandline)
- lasso selection tool (see shoffsta patch)
     (http://shoffsta.afraid.org/Projects/Xournal/)
- flatten (incl undo/redo...) - enabled only if nlayers>1
- color chooser (papercolor, pen color); have default colors and a history
  appear as palette in there!
- printing: print-options, save printer settings (throughout a session,
   and on disk) (maybe a separate config file .xournal/gnome-print-settings)
- help index
- option for highlighter to be always at bottom of its layer
- more pen/highlighter shapes (chisel)
- slanted tip pens (calligraphy)
- toolbar buttons to access custom preset tools (e.g. text or pen with settings)
- text boxes with opaque background
- recalibration upon screen resize / compensation for miscalibration
    (use ConfigureNotify event and XInput? cf "Bugs" tracker 08/2007)
- find a better behavior for vertical space tool across page boundaries ?
   config options? 1) when there's not enough space at bottom of page:
                       - resize the page
                       - move stuff to next page
                       - move stuff to a new page
                   2) when moving to another page:
                       - move everything
                       - move only what doesn't fit (??? looks hard)
   option for vert space tool to also move the background??
   (PDF: cut-and-crop by running PDF code twice with 2 different clipboxes?)
- option to save all annotated files within the .xoj
- non-antialiased version for handhelds
- customize autogenerated save file names 
- layer dialog box to set visibility status of each layer regardless of
  which layer is being edited
- option to link layer creation and visibility status for all pages
  (Eric Borghs 04/15/08)
- display corruption on scroll down when bottom of window is obscured??
  (probably a gnomecanvas or X bug -- expose event generated for wrong
  region, or not processed?)
- autosave at a regular interval in a given location
- keep only a few pages of a PDF file in memory at any given time; generate
  pages by parsing pdf info rather than generating bitmaps for all of them.
- win32 port (Matteo Abrate)
- snap-to-grid tool? (Matteo Abrate)
- EPOS 7/24/07: Thumbnails pane
- EPOS: Connect to EPOS api which sends A4 mapped points
- EPOS: Cut and Paste into OpenOffice applications and the GIMP (as bitmap??)
- EPOS: Export pages to pictures in the Jpg and Png formats.
- EPOS: Rotate Ink in custom angle.
- handwriting recognition???? (cellwriter?) unlikely. we don't have grids
  see galileon comment on 2008-07-29 to tracker #1925309: word recognizer
- handwritten stroke search in document (see cellwriter?)
  (correlate inertia-normalized strokes in lift to unit cotangent bundle?)
- option: export to PDF with incremental pages for successive layers
    (for presentations) (Daniel Brugarth 8/18/07)
- Samuel Hoffstaetter: lasso, gettext localization, sidebar thumbnails, ...
- YoYo Siska patch for desktop mode ??
- Vivek Ayer: rotate paper wrt screen (for environments where display
  rotation doesn't work): gnome_canvas_item_affine_relative(canvas->root, ...)
  would rotate all but text items (still need to modify scroll bbox, and
  adjust event coordinates by inverse rotation).
- rotate PDF background pages (individually wrt each other, see #2099935)
- switch to libglade, and allow customization of key shortcuts (accels)

- command to copy a selected shape to a keybinding that will paste it
  (so one can define symbols to insert into typed notes)  (e.g. "be able
  to bind Ctrl-B to draw a \beta" for class notes). (shape, binding) sets are
  local to one session (different for different classes; but save them into
  the xoj file maybe ?) [Felix Giannelia 09/29/2009]
