List of features to be implemented (not in any particular order)
----------------------------------------------------------------

- collaborative editing (see discussion with Erik Demaine)
- porting to Win32 and MacOS
- multiple-scenario undo history

- improve recognizer: two passes for polygons (low tolerance, then higher)
  to better detect elongated rectangles? (if low tolerance recognizer
  doesn't get a rectangle, then use higher tolerance for everything else,
  since otherwise there's too much risk of splitting a segment into 2)
- snap-to-grid (also for ruler & recognizer vertices)
  and maybe also snap-to-vertices (option for ruler and recognizer)?
- allow broken PDF with some 19-byte xref entries (LF instead of CRLF).??
  (Phil Rhoades 3/25/08)

- render page to bitmap: for export, preview, and copy-paste
    (render using libart, see how gnomecanvas does it?)
    (copy-paste: config option to render only current layer or all below?)
- cut-and-paste of selection into other apps (as bitmap; as SVG?)
- navigation sidebar with bitmap page previews
- bitmap preview for document icon in desktop environments?
- "organizer" side panel (hierarchy of notes), cf. gjots

- paste text directly into xournal, from xournal?
    (instead of starting a text item and pasting into/from it)
- increase width of spinPageNo to fit 3 digits
- a command + keyboard shortcut to switch mappings (1<->2, 1<->3, 2<->3)
     (A. Rechnitzer Sept 11, 2007)

- lasso tool
- internationalization / translation of interface
- switch to poppler instead of pdftoppm; with exact float dpi settings
- load PDF pages only on demand (create empty pixmaps at first if can
   parse PDF geometry ourselves, else try pdfinfo ??)
   (and config option to limit total memory usage for PDF bitmaps)
- ability to select entire page for copy-paste (as bitmap / reorder xournal)
- copy/paste of an entire page (beware if PDF bg is not compatible!)
- rewrite printing using GtkPrint + Cairo as GnomePrint replacement
   (keep GnomePrint option for compatibility with GTK+ <2.10)
- insert images (screen capture or from file or from clipboard), 
  not as full-page backgrounds (new ITEM type)
- convert to/from Jarnal format; to/from MS Journal format???


- sticky notes (anchor visually text box to a bg location)
- use relative paths for bg documents (e.g. annotated PDF)
- flush display queue when drawing over a slow X server?
- more paper customization (in particular, 1/2 inch graph paper)
- option to map a button to a context menu (incl. tool selection, ...)
- option to map a button to "undo"
- xournal_page-shadow.diff (Martin Kiefel Feb 5 2007)
- xoj2pdf on command line
- 'insert blank page after' command (more useful in PDF annot !)
- load images as bg if given on command-line (as with PDF on commandline)
- lasso selection tool (see shoffsta patch)
     (http://shoffsta.afraid.org/Projects/Xournal/)
- flatten (incl undo/redo...) - enabled only if nlayers>1
- color chooser (papercolor, pen color); maybe more default colors
- printing: print-options, save printer settings (throughout a session,
   and on disk) (maybe a separate config file .xournal/gnome-print-settings)
- help index
- option for highlighter to be always at bottom of its layer
- more pen/highlighter shapes (chisel)
- recalibration upon screen resize / compensation for miscalibration
    (use ConfigureNotify event and XInput? cf "Bugs" tracker 08/2007)
- find a better behavior for vertical space tool across page boundaries ?
   config options? 1) when there's not enough space at bottom of page:
                       - resize the page
                       - move stuff to next page
                       - move stuff to a new page
                   2) when moving to another page:
                       - move everything
                       - move only what doesn't fit (??? looks hard)
   option for vert space tool to also move the background??
   (PDF: cut-and-crop by running PDF code twice with 2 different clipboxes?)
- option to save all annotated files within the .xoj
- non-antialiased version for handhelds
- customize autogenerated save file names 
- layer dialog box to set visibility status of each layer regardless of
  which layer is being edited
- display corruption on scroll down when bottom of window is obscured??
  (probably a gnomecanvas or X bug -- expose event generated for wrong
  region, or not processed?)
- autosave at a regular interval in a given location
- keep only a few pages of a PDF file in memory at any given time; generate
  pages by parsing pdf info rather than generating bitmaps for all of them.
- win32 port (Matteo Abrate)
- snap-to-grid tool? (Matteo Abrate)
- EPOS 7/24/07: Thumbnails pane
- EPOS: Connect to EPOS api which sends A4 mapped points
- EPOS: Cut and Paste into OpenOffice applications and the GIMP (as bitmap??)
- EPOS: Export pages to pictures in the Jpg and Png formats.
- EPOS: Rotate Ink in custom angle.
- handwriting recognition???? (cellwriter?) unlikely. we don't have grids
- handwritten stroke search in document (see cellwriter?)
- option: export to PDF with incremental pages for successive layers
    (for presentations) (Daniel Brugarth 8/18/07)
- Samuel Hoffstaetter: lasso, gettext localization, sidebar thumbnails, ...
- YoYo Siska patch for desktop mode ??
- Vivek Ayer: rotate paper wrt screen (for environments where display
  rotation doesn't work): gnome_canvas_item_affine_relative(canvas->root, ...)
  would rotate all but text items (still need to modify scroll bbox, and
  adjust event coordinates by inverse rotation).
- switch to libglade, and allow customization of key shortcuts (accels)
